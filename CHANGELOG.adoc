|Bug
|In case the entity field configuration file doesn't exist the following error occurs:

`AttributeError: EnvConfig instance has no attribute '_EnvConfig__origin_json_str'`

This is fixed. If the configuration file doesn't exists the file will be created automatically.

|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/51[#51]
|Enhancement
|Customized version name for `.pol` and `.fed` packages.

A new property `axway.project.version` is introduced to customize the version of `.pol` and `.fed` packages. As default the value will be set to ${project.version} . The version can be overwritten by a command line property of by a defined property within the pom.xml.

*Example*

Command line

`$ mvn clean package -Daxway.project.version="${project.version}-BN20201031"`

|Enhancement
| Support removal of certificates.

A new certificate type `empty` is introduced for the `update` object of the certificate configuration file.
It indicates that a certificate will be updated with an empty certificate and therefore will be removed.

----
{

    "source": "value", <1>
    "type": "string",

    "type": "string",

    "value": null
  }
}
----
<1> The new default source for new fields is `property`.

[NOTE]
====
In case of new environmentalized fields, the configuration file has to be edited to set the value for the new fields.

In case of the source of the value should be a property the name of the property has to be specified in the `value` attribute.
Unfortunately it is easy to forget to also change the `source` attribute to `property`.
As the default source is `value` the configuration tool will just configure the name of property instead of the content of the property, without any warning or error.

To prevent this pitfall the default source for new fields is `property`.
This guarantees that the specified property exists.
Also in case of the source has to be `value`, the configuration tool forces to switch the `source` attribute.

== Version 0.11.2
[cols="1,2,<10a", options="header"]
|===
|ID|Type|Description
|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/34[#34]
|Bug
|For configuration files in the old format having fields with "property" attribute set to null, the field will not be upgraded to the newer version.

.Example
[source,json]
----
"fields": {
  "attributeValue#0": {
    "property": null, 
    "type": "string", 
    "used": true, 
    "value": "artifact"
  }
}
----

This results in the error message:

`ERROR: ValueError(u"Missing 'source' property in field 'xxxxxx' of entity 'xxxxxx'",)`

The bug is fixed and the configuration files will be upgraded to the new version, now.

|ID|Type|Description
|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/33[#33]
|Bug
|The configuration files are only updated if they are changed.

Also a bug is fixed where the configuration will not be updated even if the `used` state is changed.
If a field is marked as unused, the configuration wasn't updated even if the field is used now.

|===
|ID|Type|Description
|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/31[#31]
|Enhancement
|The `buildfed` tool is enhanced to set properties from the content of a specified file.

A new `-F NAME:FILE` command line parameter is introduced.

Example:

  $ buildfed ... -F description:config/description.txt

This will define a new property `description` which is populated from the content of the `description.txt` file.

|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/32[#32]
|Enhancement
|Build artifact information JSON.

For server and deployment archives the plugin will generate a `gateway.info.json` file.
The file contains information about the version of the artifact and its dependencies.

On configuring  the `.fed` package, the plugin passes the content of the `gateway.info.json` file as `_system.artifact.info` property to the `buildfed` tool.
This enables the developer to use the contained JSON document to build an endpoint providing information about the currently deployed version.

|Enhancement
|New property "source" for fields and certificates to specify the source for the values or passwords.

The are following advantages:

  * Easy extensibility for new sources (e.g. environment variables).
  * Easier to find missing configurations (search for `"value": null` or `"password": null`).

*Environmentalized Fields*

For field values there are separate properties ("property" and "value") to configure the field value (see example below).

.Old Format
[source,json]
----
{
  "field#0": {
    "property": null, <1>
    "type": "string", 
    "used": true, 
    "value": null <2>
  }
}
----
<1> specifies a property as the source of the field value
<2> literal field value

A new property "source" is introduced to specify the source of the field value.
The property defines the kind of the "value" property.
In case of "source" is equal to "value" the field value is directly configured by the value of the "value" property.
In case of "source" is equal to "property" the field value is retrieved from the property named by the "value" property.

.New Format
[source,json]
----
{
  "field#0": {
    "source": "property", <1>
    "type": "string",
    "used": true,
    "value": "property.name" <2>
  },
  "field#1": {
    "source": "value", <3>
    "type": "string",
    "used": true,
    "value": "field value" <4>
  }
}
----
<1> specifies a property as the source of a field value
<2> field value is retrieved from the property named `property.name`
<3> field value is retrieved directly from "value"
<4> literal field value

*Certificates*

For certificate passwords there are separate properties ("password" and "password-property") to configure the password (see example below).

.Old Format
[source,json]
----
"update": {
  "file": "cert/server.p12",
  "password": "server.password", <1> 
  "type": "p12"
}
...
"update": {
  "file": "cert/server.p12",
  "password-property": "property.name", <2> 
  "type": "p12"
}
----
<1> literal password value
<2> password is retrieved from a property named `property.name`


A new property "source" is introduced to specify the source of the certificate password.
The property defines the kind of the "password" property.
In case of "source" is equal to "password" the password is directly configured by the value of the "password" property.
In case of "source" is equal to "property" the password is retrieved form the property named by the "password" property.

.New Format
[source,json]
----
"update": {
  "file": "cert/server.p12",
  "password": "server.password", <1> 
  "source": "password", <2>
  "type": "p12"
}
...
"update": {
  "file": "cert/server.p12",
  "password": "property.name", <3> 
  "source": "property", <4>
  "type": "p12"
}
----
<1> literal password value
<2> password is retrieved directly from "password"
<3> password is retrieved from the property named `property.name`
<4> specifies a property as the source of the password

NOTE: Configuration files in the old format are automatically converted into the new format.

|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/29[#29]
|Enhancement
|Add support for environment variables for field and password configuration.

The `source` property new supports a new value `env` to specify an environment variable as the source for field values and certificate passwords.

*Environmentalized Fields*
[source,json]
----
  "field#0": {
    "source": "env", <1>
    "type": "string",
    "used": true,
    "value": "ENV_NAME" <2>
  }
----
<1> specifies an environment variable as the source of the field value
<2> field value is retrieved from the environment variable `ENV_NAME`

*Certificates*
[source,json]
----
"update": {
  "file": "cert/server.p12",
  "password": "SERVER_PASSWORD", <1> 
  "source": "env", <2>
  "type": "p12"
}
----
<1> password is retrieved from the environment variable `SERVER_PASSWORD`
<2> specifies an environment variable as the source of the password

|Enhancement
|Check expiration of configured certificates.

The plugin and the configuration tool now supports to check if configured certificates expires within a given number of days.
If at least one certificate expires within the time frame an error will be raised.

For the configuration tool the check is disabled by default.

For the plugin the default number of days is 10.
To disable the check for the plugin specify set `axway.tools.cfg.cert.expirationDays` property to -1.

|https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin/issues/18[#18]
|Enhancement
|Don't create "info" section for "update" certificates.
Information about the configured certificates are written to log instead.

Previously the configuration tool has written the "info" section (see below).
This will change a source file, which is not suitable for build environments.

.previous-cert-config.json
....
            "update": {
                "file": "cert/server.p12",

|Optionally skip `package` goal.

For CI/CD pipelines it would be usefully to separate the package and deployment phase.
A property `axway.skipPackaging` is provided to skip the `package` goal in case of the target archive already exists.

|Support simulation mode for configuration tool.

In simulation mode no output files (`.fed` or `.env`) are written.
Also non existing certificate files will be ignored.

To ensure proper configuration files, unconfigured fields or certificates will still raise a build error.

NOTE: The `buildtemplate` tool is removed as it can be fully replaced by the `buildfed` tool.

|Maven plugin now supports passphrases for reading input packages and for writing output packages.
Applicable for server and deployment packages only.

You can use the properties `axway.passphrase.in` and `axway.passphrase.out` to specify the passphrases for reading and writing packages.

_Examples:_

  ~/server-project$ mvn -Daxway.passphrase.out=changeme clean install

Generates a server archive containing passphrase protected `.pol` and `.env` packages.

  ~/deploy-project$ mvn -Daxway.passphrase.in=changeme -Daxway.passphrase.out=changed clean install

Uses a passphrase protected server archive and generates a deployment archive containing a passphrase protected `.fed` package.
